# Dotfiles

Makes it easy for me to set up new machines with my preferred settings. Feel free to get inspiration from here but I would advise building your own from scratch.

# Quick Setup

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notnotnescap/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/setup.sh | zsh
```
